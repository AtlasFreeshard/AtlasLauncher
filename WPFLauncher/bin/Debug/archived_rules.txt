You have chosen to play on a server that has been Archived.  

This means that this server is in the process of being decommissioned and will soon become unavailable.

If you are new to Dark Age of Camelot, we suggest you play on a NORMAL ruleset server.

Note that you cannot create new characters on this server. However the servers will remain accessible for a time so as to allow our current players a chance to freely transfer their existing characters, houses and guilds from these servers to a new server in the new combined cluster, Ywain. For more information on character transfers, please visit the Camelot Herald (http://www.camelotherald.com).
