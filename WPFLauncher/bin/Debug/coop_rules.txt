You have chosen to play on one of the servers that Mythic Entertainment has specifically designated as a Cooperative Server.  These servers differ from the standard DAoC servers in the following ways:


-No Realm affiliations. Players are free to join groups and guilds with any member of any other Realm. Players of all races can communicate freely with one another. 

-No PvP or RvR.  All gameplay on this server is in a PvE environment with limited PvP options. 

-Relics do not exist on this server.  Instead there are many epic-level encounters located in the frontier zones. 

-Players can shop at any store, although they can not use items that require skills they don't have. They can, however, sell loot at any store. 

-Darkness Falls is open to all players at all times. 

-Realm points are awarded to players through alternate advancement tracks.


All rules from the DAoC Rules of Conduct apply to this server.  Welcome to the Cooperative Server, and have fun playing Dark Age of Camelot!
